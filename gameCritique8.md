# Final Thoughts
TOXIKK is a true homage to the feel and excitment in a 90s game 
with better graphics. The game's features were expected and 
unexpected, incuding time trials, hidden areas/shortcuts, fun 
weapons and abilities. My favorite was the ability to jump at 
the end of an elevator to go higher, usually required in order 
to get to a certain floor or over an obstacle. Definitely 
playable and possibly worth buying full game.
