# Final Thoughts
Path Out is a cool way to see a story being told. You live his experiences and even get his personal insight on situations you 
encounter through small videos he adds at each milestone. This game doesn't have any action and yet still keeps you engaged 
through dangerous encounters and dialogue that peeks your interest. Overall, the game is a great tribute to his story and I 
enjoyed the art and narrative style of the game.
