# Final Thoughts
Medusa's Labyrinth is definitely scary. The execution of the graphical story elements immerse the player into the tense, 
on edge, or fearful feelings horror movies have. The music, animations, and actions feel believable and unexpected. I 
think the game sets a standard for maze and horror games.
