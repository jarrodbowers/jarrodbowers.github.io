# Final Thoughts
WWF2 is a challenging game for those with a lack of vocabulary. While it is a chance to learn more, it mostly just has you placing tiles until it makes a word. The game lets you know if its not a word, and you have to click the word to actually see its definition, which is usually just an explination of how they don't have a definition but it's a valid WWF word. I would say they could make it better but it's always fun calling out the person for making up a word.
